How do you connect to database using Java ? 
​
​
We use JDBC API comes with JDK  
In order to connect to a specific Relational Database management system , we need to have a driver of that database vendor like oracle, mysql , postgress , MariaDB .,.,........
​
what is a JDBC driver : It's a jar file that contains packages and classes and it has implementation of JDBC standard 
​
There are 3 major interface that used to programatically access database 
​
​
---  all these interfaces are coming from 
   java.sql package 
​
Connection ,
	 we use DriverManager and connection String , database credentials to make connection 
​
	Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(connection_str,db_user,db_password);
​
Statement , 
	 we can create statement object using connection object, it has ability to executeQuery
​
	  Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
​
ResultSet 
	 Once statement object query is executed , it will result in a ResultSet object that store entire result, 
​
	 ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM REGIONS");
	 rs.next()  to move to first row 
​
Eech resultset can contain 1 result of the query run 
if you want to run another sql query ,create another ResultSet Object
